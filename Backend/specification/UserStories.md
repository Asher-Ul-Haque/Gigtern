### Stories 

1. Driver
As a driver, I want to 
* Log in using my verified IIITD ID so that the platform can establish trust and my identity
* List a ride by specifying my route (start / end points), departure time, number of available seats, and suggested contribution per seat, so that passengers can find me
* View all incoming ride requests for my listed ride so that I can decide whether to accept or decline passengers
* Accept a ride request so that the passenger can proceed with payment and the seat is reserved
* Mark a ride as complete after dropping off the passenger, so that the fare is released from my escrow and my reputation score is updated.

2. Passenger 
As a passenger, I want to 
* Log in using my verified IIITD ID, just like the driver, to ensure I am also part of the trusted community
* Search for available rides based on a desired route and time so that I can find the best match for my commute 
* See the driver's reputation score, name and gender, and the gender of existing passengers, before requesting a ride, to ensure safety and trust 
* Request a seat in a specific ride and receive confirmation of my request from the driver.
* Pay for the ride after the driver accepts the request so that my seat is secured 
* Rate the driver after the ride is complete so that I can contribute to the community's trust system

3. Admin
As an admin, I want to 
* Be able to do see everything a passenger can see
